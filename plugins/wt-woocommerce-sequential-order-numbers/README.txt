Sequential order number for WooCommerce is the best plugin to generate sequential or custom order numbers for existing and new WooCommerce orders.

== Description ==

The Sequential Order Number for WooCommerce plugin lets you format or re-arrange existing and new WooCommerce order numbers into a clean consecutive sequence.

WordPress uses an ID system for posts, pages, and media files. WooCommerce uses the same ID for order numbers too. When a new WooCommerce order is created it may not always get the next order number in sequence as the ID may have already been used up by another post or page. Using this custom order number plugin, you will always get sequential numbers for your WooCommerce orders.

When you activate the sequential order number plugin, if you have no orders in your store, your orders will start counting from order number 1 or the custom starting number specified. If you have existing orders, the order number will pick up from your highest order number.
